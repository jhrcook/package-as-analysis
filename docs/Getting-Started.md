# Getting Started

Setting up the package is mostly automated and is well documented in [R Packages](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/intro.html) by Hadley Wickham. If you are running the analysis on your local machine, I would recommend using [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com) (which you likely already do), but this is possible to do on a remote computing cluster (which is how I work). I begin by going through the steps of setting up the basic package framework, which is the same for local or remote work. Following that, there is a section for how I work remotely. This can be skipped if you only work locally or if you already have a system you enjoy (though I highly recommend the system I currently use). I finish off with a few extras that I recommend using, but are not necessary.

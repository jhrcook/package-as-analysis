# Framework

## Introduction

I have decided to introduce the R packagge framework before going through the set-up process because, quite frankly, I think this is more important. There are many sites that outline the steps of creating an R package (they likely do it better than I will next chapter), but the main point of this book is how to make the R package into a data analysis project. Therfore, understanding the use of the framework should be the reader's focus, here.

I try to adhere to the following process for each peace of the framework:

1. what is it and what is its main role?
2. when does it need to be used or adjusted?
3. what is unique about its use for a data analysis project?



[TODO]

Include a subsetion on each main peice of package:

* what is it for
* things to be wary of
* specific use for data analysis
